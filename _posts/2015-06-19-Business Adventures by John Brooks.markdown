Business Adventures by John Brooks is informative and enjoyable. The author takes a financial snapshot of the 60’s and analyzes 12 business adventures that happened during the period. In my opinion, the 12 stories show that hard work, optimism and a desire to do good are necessary to run large business machinery. The book teaches a lot about economics, management practices and human behavior. Maybe that is why Warren Buffett and Bill Gates love this book.

John Brooks has interviewed the people involved in these adventures in great detail. He uses these interviews to circumspectly narrate tales about these business adventures. His narration makes these insipid events in history more lively and personal.

The author compares the pros/cons of income tax system as it is today and how it came into being. This is a very lucid article. The author then goes on to tell us that income tax was 
“a net for redistributing money … but capital gains provisions and loopholes have made income tax a mass tax. A shift from low-rate tax relying for revenue on the high income group to a high rate tax relying on middle income group and low income group”
Then the second half of the article is about how the income tax system was digitized in 1964 under the then IRS commissioner Caplin. How he thought of IRS as an 
“enormous self-assessment tax system in which people voluntarily pay with little direct enforcement”.
Then the system under the next IRS commissioner Sheldon S Cohen is also described. Along with the description of some of the tax loopholes. This chapter makes for a wonderful read.
