##Review

The Lightness of being distills the concepts of reltivity, Quantum chromodynamics, Quantum electrodynamics and unification to a downright pedestrian language. It allows a person like me to grasp such a vast knowledge in a relatively short duration of time. A great read to brink you up to speed with the latest in science.

The language is simple and the tone of the book is comical. The author tries to bring in a storylike narrative to drive home the dense concepts being talked about. The concepts are explained in a very imaginative way and the book is very well edited. This book also manages to conceal a generous amount of life lessons as well.

The chapters on "the GRID" and "SUSY" are a bit insipid but the author owns up to the fact in the book. These have important scientific facts and they tend to be drab.

All in all, this is an excellent read. I would definately recomend this book to one and all.

###Summary

> Classical physics acquisced about mass as being massy. ... Gravity pulls energy not mass. Mass is energy at rest. Mass is the irreducible representation of Poincare's group.

Nuclear physics was a blooming field in the 1930's. They smashed many atoms and sub atomic particles to understand the composition of matter. But to no avail. It was giving them more sub atomic particles. They called them hadrons.

electron + positron -> 10 Pi Mesons + proton + antiproton
2 x 10^-28 gms      -> 6 x 10^-24 gms

At that time Quarks / Partons were only mathematical propositions by Gellman and Feynmann to solve theoretical equations. The particle smashing experiments in the ultrastroboscopic-nano-microscope evetually lead to the discovery of quarks. That lead to the development of quantum mechanics. Then came gluons to further explain them. Quarks and Gluons are the final building blocks which form the whole universe. They have weird properties and they are qualitatively different in the sense that they are "embodied ideas" (captured entropies).

Gluons were discovered ass a class of equations called Chen Ning Yang & Robert Mills in 1954 as a mathematical generalization of Maxwells Equations of Electrodynamics. THe maxwell equations were generalized to support different type of charges and also be symmetrical.

In 1973 The author Frank Wilczekproposed gluons as a type of generalized Maxwell equations to accomodate more charges. They are called color charges.
Color Charges : David Gross & Frank Wilczek in 1973.

In the early 1960's Hadrons are found. Murray Gell-Mann & George Zweig propose the quark model. hadrons of different mass, spins & lifetimes can be assembled using quarks(up, down and strange).
Meson = Q + Q'. Baryon = 3Q. AntiBaryon = 3Q'. These different alignments of different quarks are allowed in different states (orbits where there is a high probability of localizing the quarks). These different states have different energies; electrons in atom has different energies. The different energies represnt different masses using the equation m = E/(c^2).

Early 1970's : Jereome Friedman, henry Kendall, richard Taylor & collaborators at SLAC studies protons. SLAC gives the precise position & momentum for very precise time by taking multiple snapshots and taking a fourier transform. Each image developed by SLAC looks like pepperoni pizza. With the pepperoni's at different places. The fourier transform changes it to give us the position of partons / quarks in the proton.

Asymptotic freedom
__________________
When no charge is either felt ot exterted, i.e. charge -> 0 due to antiscreening. The center/seed particle at the middle of the particle cloud has virually 0 charge, But due to virtual screening its charge seems to increase as distance increases. But amid a system of particles with virtual particles antiscreening their effects are nullified.

In 1973 the author and Gross came up with a relativistic Quantum Field theory to explain this. The author called this generalized Yang and Mills equations as QCD.

LEP shows us that the quarks(fundamental particles) are covered with their cloud of virtual particles which antiscreen them. When the particle and its cloud falls out of equlillibrium a radiation of quark-antiquark pairs is seem. Gluons also are seem
Feynmann diagrams for e + e' -> Gamma virtual photon -> Q+ Q'.
In LEP the quark was out of equillibrium due to being suddenly expelled  out from a virtual photon.


Symmetry
_________
Distinction without a difference. <Insert QCD Lagrangian Equations>
QED equations were in place by 1931 but people were getting nonsensical results out of them until 1950. In 1950 Hans Bethe, Sin-Hiro, Tomonaga(check), Julian Schwinger, Feynmann & Freeman Dyson straigtened things out. Essence of QED is that photons respond to presence & motion of electric charge, It explains electrodynamics, theory of electricity and magnetic fields & radiation. All through Feynmann Diagrams.

QCD has 3 colors(Red Blue and Green) and 3 flavours(Up Down and Strange).
Photon:electroMagnetic:QED :: Gluon:ColorCharge:QCD
But QCD's charge deflection and response is more dramatic and vigerous. In QCD the forces are stronger.
Gluons carry the unbalanced color charge and respond to each other. Color Gluon Fields are the solution to the problem of symmetrically changing the color field of a quark. The equations are tough to explain. But sure enough they were soon seen in reality through experiments.


GRID
_____
QCD teaches us that the empty space is actually a powerful medium filled with activity and virtual particles that are alive for only seconds.
We use the term GRID as 'space-time' has the historic baggage of emptiness. But grid is essentially a new way to look at space time.
GRID view is actually viewing empty space as a super imposition of different grids over empty space
EmptySpace + Quantum Fields + Metric Fields + Condensates + Dark Energy (4 layers on empty space make the grid)
Matter originally only had the properties of shape and motion. Now we add these 4 layers.
Einstiens first paper in 1905 declares the introduction of luminoferous ether. It bound the relativity theory of Maxwell(Electro Magnetic) with Newtonian as one equation bound by space time. ElectroMagnetic relativity was asserted by Lorentz and Poincare. Physical relativity by Newton. Einstien asserted the primacy of Electro Magnetic relativty.
Max Plank had put the idea of Quantum Mechanics in 1899. He said atoms could exchange energy with electromagnetic fields only in discrete units(quantas). But Planks ideas were not standing with other physical laws at that time. It worked experimentally but not in theory. Einstien later expanded the theory to state that light always exists in quanta of momentum and energy. Einstien has doubts on his theory until 1909 where he states in his paper that "he thought that each singularity point was surrounded by a plane wave. If many singularity points were next to each other then the superposition of these waves would give rise to EM theory of light." He did not think that the maxwell electromagnetic fields had a life of their own; He thought that they arose from sigularity points, i.e. EM did not fill space but concentrated around singularities. Today we tink of them as photons. 1905 special relativity tells us to think of space as a ether based theory of Electro Magnetism. E= m * c^2 .
In 1920's paper on general relativity he said that 1905 special relativity paper tells that the space as per special relativity theory space is a ether based medium. The general relativity paper introduced a new field. Gravitational field.
Special theory unified EM and newtonian physics. General theory introduced a field based theory of gravity. A direct result of special relativity is quantum fields. Quantum electro magnetic fields that obey maxwell equations. These fields have energy packed in discrete units, which we call today as photons. Feynmann gave up when  he realized that the equations for QED introduced space filling fields that allowed interation between electrons and photons. EM field interacts with fluctuation in electron field.

Condensates
___________
Empty space gives out a Q + Q' as QQ' molecules. These are called 'symbol:sigma' mesons. sigma meson can be verified using their vinrations symbol:pi mesons which lead to nobel prize in 1979 which got us the standard model or GLashow-Weinberg-Salam model.
Activity in the W & Z boson fields generates weak interaction. Just like an activity in photon field creates electromagnetism; activity in color gluon fileds creates strong interaction.

Standard Model
______________
Just like the electron behaves in a super conductor, the W&Z boson behave in a superconducted manner in space. This makes us wonder if space is a giant Super conductor?
Electrons respond very vigeously in a superconductor to electric and magnetic fields. Photon is a moving electromagnetic wave which we have evolved to sense. The electrons try to balance the electromagnetic disturbance in a superconductor. Hence electron causes a drag on the photon in a superconductor causing the photon to slow down. The slowed down photon in a superconductor obeys the same equations as an object with mass. So if space was a good superconductor for (W & Z)bosons, then they get mass. But then what is the field that they exist in? How do we explain that? The answer is that the QQ' pair falls short of contributing to boson mass by a factor of thousand. So the scientists are searching for (Peter Higgs, physicist, who pioneered the idea)higgs condensate. So the idea comes along that the space is a multilayered, multicolored superconductor.

Metric Field
____________
In 1920 Einstoen said - "According to general theory of relativity space without ether is unthinkable; for in such space there not only would be no propogation of light but also no possibility of existance for standards of space and time, nor therefore any space time intervals in the physical sense."
Like the grid in the mercator map of the earth that teaches us how to interpretspace along North and East axis. Our 3D world also has/needs a grid of instructions which is called the metric field. If we add time as another dimension to that field we get the space time relativity. One guys time is another guys space time.
In general theory of relativity Einstien used the concept of curved spacetime to construct a theory of gravity. v = u + at(Newtons 2nd Law). Einstien modified it to explain that bodies move in the straigtest possible path through space time. When space time is curved teh path also wiggles to adapt to the local geometry, i.e. the bodies respond to the metric field.
So metric field = curved spacetime. Looking at it as a field view makes the equations similar to other fundamental equations. The gravity explained in terms of field view looks like the field theory of electromagnetism. Electric and magnetic fields bend the path of charged particles. So the grid view of gravity is that the metric fields bend the motion of objects, Consistency among the equations of field(metric), electromagnetism, QCD(Color charge) & weak interaction is a lot. Consistency demands that metric field be a quantum field, i.e. the fluctuations in the metric field be spontaneous. But the quantum nature of metric field is not yet well studied. Explaining quantum gravity would unify the forces.

The Grid Weighs
_______________
So the fact that the grid weights as & it has a non zero density is a proof of its physical reality.
Grid density = Einstiens cosmological term = "dark energy"
In 1917, Einstien proposed a modification to his original equations of 1915 because of cosmology. As per Newtons 1692 understanding if the universe did not have a constant density Gravity would cause it to collapse onto itself. To allow his general relativity gravity to be consistant with special relativity, the only mathematically feasible solution was to add a cosmological constant term. By 1920's(Edwin Hubble) there was proof that the universe was actually expanding. So the cosmological term actually started to make sense.
So space has a constant density symbol:rho and alsi a constant pressure everywhere in space 'p' such that rho = p/(c^2). It means that even if the space was expanded or contracted, the pressure that goes along with the density gets modified in such a way that the density always remains constant.
By 2001, scientists were able to measure cosmic densities and pressures separately by observing the cosmic microscope background radiation. In 2001 scientists also proclaimed that there is much more matter than that is observable & 70% is uniformly distributed.
in 1998 scientists/cosmic observers reported that the rate of expansion of our universe is increasing. The reason given was universal negative pressure. People started using the term dark energy as a standard to refer to both the mass and negative pressure of the grid.

GRID recap
__________
- The grid fills space and time
- Every grid fragment has the same basic properties.
- The grid is alive with quantum(spontaneous) activity. You must disturb it to observe it.
- The grid contains enduring material components. The cosmos is a multilayered, multicoloured cuperconductor.
- The grid contails a metric field that gives grid spacetime rigidity and causes gravity.
- The grid weighs with a universal density


Computing Matter
________________
John Wheeler created the term "Black Hole" & "its from bits" i.e. finding mathematical structures (bits) that mirror reality so completely that no meaningful aspect escapes it.
QCD equations allow computers to churn out photons, neutrons. Its from bits. "Also mass without mass" - another 'wheelerism'
Image on page 126 -> Origin of photons (95%)mass.
The colour charge of a quark creates a disturbance in the grid's gluon field that grows with distance like a storm. To disturb the field requires lots of energy.
If you bring an antiquark close enough to the quark you can cancel out the disturbances. But, Heisenbergs uncertainity principle does not allow the two QQ' to be close precisely and have the same momentum. Einstiens 2nd law tells us E=m*c^2. m = E/(c^2). The nature of Q & Q' cannot be made 0 simultaneously. The balance E gives us the mass of the 95% of the matter.
This is similar to the energy levels of an atom. The electron wavicle almost overlaps the +ve proton thus almost negating the charge but allowing for possible compreomise situations which correspond to energy levels of an atom. So the inertia of a body depends upon its energy content.
The masses of the particles sound the frequency with which the space vibrates. m = E/c^2. E = h* symbol:mu.
Plank introduced 'h' in 1899 that lauched quantum theory, i.e., atoms emit or absorb light in of frequncy mu in multiples of h.
Eintien went a step further with photon hypothesis(1905); that light of frequency mu is always organized in packets of energy E = h * symbol:mu.
Shrodinger made it the basic equation for wave function. That gave us the shrodinger equation of 1926, i.e., the wave function of any state with energy E vibrates at a frequency mu igven by mu = E / h => mu = mc^2 / h.
So the empty space plays a tune a frequency by getting different combinations of quarks, electrons, photons, gluons ... (The Bits represent the Its) and allowing them to settle their disturbance at a frequncy mu that also describes their mass 'm'. Our mind does a lossy compression of the data it recieves from the universe. And decoding the messages is physics.
In 1846, 200 years after Newton encoded keplers 3 laws of planetory motion in his laws of gravity, we observe discrepancies in the orbit of Uranus. Urbion Le Verrier found he could account for these by assuming a new planet Neptune!
Einstiens theory of gravity - general relativity - spacetime is a curved landscape created by bodies in it.

#AKHIL : 
#"""Gravity localizes the field disturbances, i.e. mass. This means the double slit experiment was a consequence of gravity. Mass is a disturbance in the field & gravity interacts with these disturbances. Interacting disturbaces are in sync so action at a distance. But observing introduces new disturbances breaking the sync so wave particle duality  """

So gravity is m = E / c^2 where E is the energy difference between QQ' pais gluon field disturbance balancing act. It is a compromise in the equillibrium.
This E is in a sense a disturbance in a field. Mass is the residual disturbance left our after overlapping Q - Q' disturbances almost negate out each other.


Why Protons have such less mass
_______________________________
Protons mass is a compromise. Quarks carry a color charge which disturbs the gluon field. This disturbance is succeptible to antiscreening. So its effect snowballs with the help of virtual particles over a distance. The antiscreening effect grows in strength over distances. It is weaker in proximity & stronger over a distance. Hence it requires a lot of energy to keep sustaining the antiscreening over large distances. To be in equllibrium the antiscreening of a quark is cancelled by pairing with an antiquark. But to cancel out a quark & antiquark must be completely superimposed. But quantum mechanics does not allow a definate position to a particle. Particles have a spread of possible positions, described by its wave function, i.e. wavicles. To force a wavicle into a state with small spread in positions requires a lot of energy. The cost to completely localize quark & antiquark such that it cancels out each others antiscreening is prohibitive. Hence there will be some residual energy due to not completely cancelled out gluon field disturbances. Mass arises out of this residual energy m = E / c^2.
The way the disturbance in the filed grows with distance is closely related to asymptotic freedom. "Asymptotic effect was a subtle feedback effect from virtual particles" or "vaccum polarization" - where the grid antiscreens the charge.
Because the disturbance is due to how the grid reacts ti color charge, its very less in small distances and keeps growing. So in small distances the difference in energy is also very very small & hence the mass of proton is miniscule.
Max Plank was deeply involved in the research that inaugurated quantum theory in 1899-1900. In december in December 1900 he introduced Planck's constant h to solve the old pythagoros of Samos’ question of absolute units. Plank noted that across the universe three physical laws are constant c the speed of light G Newtons gravitational constant and h Planck's constant. He derived an absolute units of length 
L subscript p equals the square root of h  G By c cube. Mass,
M subscript p equals the square root of h C By G, and Time,
T subscript P equals the square root of h G by c power 5 
The 20th century physicists realized that C G and h play the role of conversion factors needed to express a profound physical concept.
- Special relativity mixes space and time into spacetime. It does so using Lorentz Transforms a.k.a. boosts. To do this you need a conversion factor b/w a unit of space and a unit of time. The conversion factor is 'c'.
- Quantum theory says E=h*mu. Wave particle duality. Where h is the conversion factor. It also says that momentum is inverely proportinal to wavelength symbol:lambda.
- General relativity says that energy momentum density inducess space time curvature. 'G' is the conversion factor.

The problem with photons mass being too little and gravity too feeble is that protons mass is a compromise between gluon field energy disturbance & quark localization. The reason for photons mass is the basic strength of the seed - the color charges of the quark that gets antiscreened, The rate if growth of antiscreening is slow initially and rapid as we go further.  So the strength of seed charge determines the rate of growth of bloom field of gluon field energy, once this energy becomes large enough that it cannot be sustained it has to be compreomised by an antiquark & the amount of hit in quantum localization energy to localize the quars & hence the value of the mass, i.e., Stronger the seed. So if we measure the strong force between the localized quarks which form the seed gluon disturbances we soon see that the discrepancy between our older estimate of 10^-40 order reduces to 1/25. So we can explain the apparant feebleness of gravity.

#IS BEAUTY TRUTH
________________

We were very eautifully able to explain why gravity appears to be feeble and hence why the mass of the proton is small by observing the laws of physics. But to verify them we would need to craete energies for larger than LHC can measure. We need to look elsewhere.
The standard / core model organizes the particles as we find them. It has helpedis develop lasers, ultra small & reliable computer memories, nuclear reactors.

##Unification :-
We now understand Strong interaction & its theory QCD. QED is the modern theory of electro dynamics. Strong interaction of QCD explains how the color charges of the gluon fields cause the creation of photons & neutrons out of quark quarks & gluons. The color charges are almost balanced. But residual forces (the delta in localization of quarks) bind proton and neutrons togeather in an atomic nuclei. The electromagnetic interaction of the hypercharge in return binds electrons to the nuclei. This almost balances the electrnic charges but the residual electrnic charges causes creation of molecules & materials. The QED describes all electromagnetic radiation as well.

The weak interaction performs alchemy. It changes different quark flavours into one another & different leptons into one another. Weak interaction causes nuclear chemistry. If one up quark in a proton is converted into a down quark the proton loses its charge and it becomes a neutron. It causes the atomic nucleus of one element to become another element. Starts derive energy by converting protons into neutrons.

So right now we explain weak interaction as vertical transformations in the core model & strong interactions as horizontal transformations. And unified maxwell equations that explain color charges &  QCD along with QED. But we have left out gravity. Mathematically we can include gravity if we use Einstien-Hilbert action for field metric of the grid, use minimal coupling to matter field & quantize for flat space. So general relativity can be fit in with the core easily(Ex:- GPS). Secondly "Neutrinos" are not in the core yet. Their non zero mass was established in 1998, the heaviest neutrino has one millionth the mass of an electron. If we allow neutrinos to have non zero mass the core gets unbalanced and we need to add exotic particles to balance the core.
There are 2 more complications -
1. There are 2 types of particles. Bosons and fermions. Fermions are quarks & loptons(QCD-strong interaction). Bosons are particles that act as energy carriers in feynmann diagrams. Through grid superconductivity & superfluidity at high perssures and energies their differences becomes almost nil. The bosons are photons, gluons & W and Z bosons. They are the energy carriers of EM, strong and weak interactions. The masses and mixings of guage boson causes problem. The weak interaction symmetry field bosons are W+, W- and W0 and one hypercharge guage boson B0. Particles created by mixing of W+, by W- and a mixture of W0-B0 have a non zero masses. Disturbances in the above mixture produce 'mass'-ive particles Z bosons. Disturbance of W0 & B0 remain massless. W0B0 massless combination is called a photon.
W boson-weak interaction & Z zero charge electrically and weak
2. There are 3 families of quark lepton pairs. wiki/Guage_boson for image. SO they interact and decay into one another, Ideally they should have no mass at all. But they have due to grid superconductivity. There are 3 symmetries. S(3) symmetry among 3 types of color charges which comes with 8 guage bosons that are effected by color charges. They transform horizontally in the core model. S(2) symmetry among 2 additional color charges that explain electro weak interaction. This is the vertical transformations in the Core model. U(1) describes hypercharge that causes electromagnetism along with S(2). The code model also has a L&R subscripts for its particles. That represents chirality. The particles having different spin interact differently. They have differentc harges (EM) as well. The core leaves 3 force EM, strong, weak separately. Particles form clusters of size 6,3,3,2 and 1 & they have weird charges,

Mathematically the most convincing way to put them togeather is to use a transformation called the SO(10). Doing so fits togeather the scatterd clusters of quarks & leptons togeather. This is called teh charge account. In SO(10) half get +1 charge the other half get -1 charge & can be transformed into one another using RBG color charge fields. What this translates into for core accout from charge account is tat the color charges RBG cancel out and only negative charge is left for electron. The N-neutrino has no electric or weak colro charge (Green, Purple) or Strong Color charge(R, B, G). This allows us to add on extra particles symbol:mu(Super:R) that allow neutrinos to have tiny mass. Thus we get the unified theory (17.2 for diagrams)

But we observe that the relative strengths of the forces does not look similair. Symmetry should dictate them to be similar. The grid distorts or vision of the forces as the grid is not an empty medium but a field filled with activity and virtual particles. To see it clearly we would need to resolve these forces to a very short distances for a very short time. To do this we need a hig power accelerator. But basic math and imagination tells us that (Fig 18.2) these energies do not match! Our beautiful theory of unification failed!! The sould of our unification is
electron <--> quark
photon   <--> gluon
But we need to do this
electron <--> quark
  ^            ^
  |            |
  V            V
photon   <--> gluon


SUSY - Super Symmetry
_____________________
SO(10) unified gauge bosons in a same cluster; and quarks and lepton in the same cluster. But ordinary symmetry cannot bring them into same custer as they are particles of different spins. To unify these, SYSY states that, like how we added a boost symmetry for special relativity, we will add a dimensional boost. Instaed of adding a constant motion in space or time we create multiple dimensions. When a body moves through a quantum dimension it gets displaced. Its spin changes. The superboost moves the particles & changes their spin. When a quantum particle moves through quantum dimensions its mass and spin changes- so does its position. But its charge remains the same(Color and EM).
Just like maxwell equations predicted moving Electric fields. SUSY predicts new fields. It doubles them. If we try to correct for the distortion due to these new fields & plot the strength of EM, strong and weak at short distances and large energies they meet at around 16.5 x log(subscript 10)(symbol:my . GeV). And surprise surprise gravity fits too!!
LHC produces lots if data of lot of powerful explosions with energy enough to break individual quanta of the condensates. To make the Higgs particle. Or any other similar particle that makes the grid a superconductor.

Dark Matter & Dark Energy
_________________________
Astronomers discovered at the end of 20th century that dark matter that does not interact with Color, EM charges consistes of 25% of universes mass. It is clustered as lumps and clumps around galaxies. They extend for a far grater distance than normal matter & is very sparse and forms halos around galaxies.
Dark energy forms 70% of the matter. It onfluences gravitationally but has shown no other interaction

The SUSY's predictions of some partner particles matches the description of dark matter. Matter that is neutral to charges & extremely long lived. QCD fails to forbit one small behaviour that is not observed. robert Peccei & Helen Quinn expand the equations to prevent it from occouring. Frank Wilzeck showed that the new equations predict a now very light weakly interacting particles called axions. Axions are a serious candidate too. Maybe both are right.


This book is a simple guide to start and run a startup. The author focuses on
creating simple businesses like travel websites and ticket books. It is a quick read. The book is well researched and this shows in all the details that the book provides. The book also shows the author's lifestyle. It touches all the topics of starting a startup and provides inspirational stories. 

![100 Dollar Startup](/assets/images/100_dollar_startup_1.jpg)

**The Good:-**

  
The author provides a definitive guide with examples for starting and running a
startup. He talks about many decisions that a “$100 entrepreneur” would have to
take and defends each piece of advise with lots of examples; lots of them. The
topics that I like how the author covers are :-

1.  Choosing a business idea

2.  Finding customers

3.  Increasing your market share

4.  Advertisement and raising funds among others.

  
**The Bad:-**

The author tries to give many examples about why it is a good idea to start your
own business. But proof by examples can only be used to disprove an idea and not
actually prove it.

Main themes of the book:-

1.  Find a right mixture of something you love to do, something people will pay
    you to do and something you are good at.

2.  Starting your own business in today's day and age does not require a huge
    investment.

3.  Testing and implementing your ideas is crucial.

4.  Growing a business through traditional advertising from the data set he
    studied is useless.

5.  It is always better to invest in winners. (successful ideas than invest to
    improve failures)
