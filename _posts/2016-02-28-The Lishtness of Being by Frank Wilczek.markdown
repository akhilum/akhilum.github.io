## Review ##

The Lightness of being distills the concepts of reltivity, Quantum chromodynamics, Quantum electrodynamics and unification to a downright pedestrian language. It allows a person like me to grasp such a vast knowledge in a relatively short duration of time. A great read to bring you up to speed with the latest in science.

The language is simple and the tone of the book is comical. The author tries to bring in a storylike narrative to drive home the dense concepts being talked about. The concepts are explained in a very imaginative way and the book is very well edited. This book also manages to conceal a generous amount of life lessons as well.

The chapters on "the GRID" and "SUSY" are a bit insipid but the author owns up to the fact in the book. These have important scientific facts which tend to be drab.

All in all, this is an excellent read. I would definately recomend this book to one and all.

### Summary ###

For me this book told a story of human grit and determination to determine what are these concepts of time, space and energy. This book spoke to me and helped me understand the history. Here is a brief timeline :-

_________


#### 1692 : ####
	
Newton and his contemporaries gave mathematical reasoning to help us describe the behaviour of light, gravity and forces. We know today that gravity actually attracts energy and not mass, but in 1692, they did not have the right tools to answer such questions. This can be seen from their frustration in works like [The Bucket Argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_argument).

![Newtons Bucket](/images/assets/LightnessOfBeingNewtonsBucket.jpg)

___________

#### 1873 : ####

James Clerk Maxwell and Michael Faraday layout the theory of classical electromagnetism. They represent electricity and magnetism as waves. This helped develop motors, dynamos and lamps.

__________

#### 1899 : ####

Max Plank said that atoms could exchange energy only in packets, a.k.a. *Quantas*. He came to this result as a conclusion to solve the age old problem of absolute units laid out by Pythagoras of Samoa.
Max Plank laid out the universal constants for time, speed and energy.

![Absolute Plank Units](/assets/images/LightnessOfBeing_PlankUnits.gif)

The 20th century physicists realized that *c, G and h* play the role of conversion factors needed to express a profound physical concept.

	* Special relativity mixes space and time into spacetime. It does so using Lorentz Transforms a.k.a. boosts. To do this you need a conversion factor between a unit of space and a unit of time. The conversion factor is *c*.
	* Quantum theory says E=h*&mu;. Wave particle duality. Where *h* is the conversion factor. It also says that momentum is inverely proportinal to wavelength &lambda;.
	* General relativity says that energy momentum density inducess space time curvature. *G* is the conversion factor.

At that time Plank has correct equations but the results were inconsistent with the existing ideas and laws at that time. It was experimentally verified but theoretically his ideas were an outcast.

__________

#### 1905 : ####

Einstein expanded the theory to state that light always exists in quanta of momentum and energy.
Chemistry has made a huge progress and had reached the atomic stage. Classical electrodynamics thought of electricity as a fluid and that it needed a medium to flow. The turn of the 20th century saw the beginning of Quantum Electrodynamics or *QED*. Which explained that electricity actually moved through vacuum as a wavicle or a particle-wave. QED tried to explain the 1897 Hertz experiment of movement of electricity through vacuum. Einstein had doubts on his theory until 1909 where he states in his paper that "he thought that each singularity point was surrounded by a plane wave".
His 1909 paper explained how photons have both momentum and energy - wave particle duality. If many singularity points were next to each other then the superposition of these waves would give rise to EM theory of light." He thought that the photons were localized EM fields which arise around the singularity points, i.e., EM did not fill space but concentrated around singularities. 1905 special relativity tells us to think of space as a ether based theory of Electro Magnetism. This theory gave us the equation E=mc<sup>2</sup> .

___________

#### 1915 : ####

Einstein gave us the general theory of relativity. This theory models space as space time and explains how matter and energy can interact with space and time. His theories were proven experimentally. 

___________

#### 1917 : ####

In 1917, Einstein proposed a modification to his original equations of 1915 because cosmologists discovered that the universe is not collapsing onto itself due to gravity. As per Newtons 1692 understanding if the universe did not have a constant density, then Gravity would cause it to collapse onto itself. To allow his general relativity gravity to be consistent with special relativity, the only mathematically feasible solution was to add a cosmological constant term. By the 1920's, Edwin Hubble showed that the universe was actually expanding. So the cosmological term actually started to make sense.

In 1918 -1925 Einstein developed the Bose-Einstein statistics with *Satendra Nath Bose* to describe Bose-Einstein condensates. Which form the basis of our super fluidity, super conductivity and the GRID.

So space has a constant density &rho; and a constant pressure everywhere in space *p* such that 
	
> &rho; = *p/(c<sup>2</sup>)*.

It means that even if the space was expanded or contracted, the pressure that goes along with the density gets modified in such a way that the density always remains constant. This is the *GRID* density we will refer to later.

___________

#### 1920 : ####

In 1920's paper on general relativity he said that 1905 special relativity paper tells that the space as per special relativity theory space is a ether based medium. The general relativity paper introduced a new field - Gravitational field.

Special theory unified electromagnetism and Newtonian physics. General theory introduced a field based theory of gravity. A direct result of special relativity is quantum fields. Quantum electro magnetic fields that obey Maxwell equations. These fields have energy packed in discrete units, which we call today as photons.

##### Metric Field #####

____________

>	"According to general theory of relativity space without ether is unthinkable; for in such space there not only would be no propogation of light but also no possibility of existance for standards of space and time, nor therefore any space time intervals in the physical sense." - Einstein, 1920

Like the grid on the map of the earth tells us how to interpret distance. Our 3D world also has a grid of instructions which is called the metric field. If we add time as another dimension to that field we get the space time relativity. One guys time is another guys space time.

![Metric Field](/assets/images/LightnessOfBeingGeneralRelativity.jpg)

In general theory of relativity Einstein used the concept of curved space-time to construct a theory of gravity and explained momentum as bodies move in the straightest possible path through space time. When space time is curved the path also wiggles to adapt to the local geometry, i.e. the bodies respond to the metric field. The equations of the field view of gravity are symmetrical to the field view of electromagnetism.

___________

#### 1930 : #### 

Nuclear physics was a blooming field in the 1930's. They smashed many atoms and sub atomic particles to understand the composition of matter, but to no avail. It was giving them more sub atomic particles. They called them hadrons.

electron + positron &rarr; 10 &Pi; Mesons + proton + antiproton
2 x 10^-28 gms  &rarr;  6 x 10^-24 gms

At that time Quarks / Partons were a mathematical propositions by Gellman and Feynman to solve theoretical equations. The particle smashing experiments in the ultrastroboscopic-nano-microscope evetually lead to the discovery of quarks. That lead to the development of quantum mechanics. Then came gluon's to further explain them. Quarks and Gluons are the final building blocks which form the whole universe. They have weird properties and they are qualitatively different in the sense that they are *embodied ideas* (captured entropies).

___________

#### 1954 : ####

QED equations were in place by 1931 but people were getting nonsensical results out of them until 1950. In 1950 Hans Bethe, Sin-Hiro, Tomonaga, Julian Schwinger, Feynman and Freeman Dyson used Feynman diagrams to correct and explain QED.  The essence of QED is that photons respond to presence and motion of electric charge. It explains electrodynamics, theory of electromagnetic fields and radiation.

*Gluons* were discovered as a solution to a class of equations called Chen Ning Yang &Amp; Robert Mills equations in 1954. They were a mathematical generalization of Maxwell's Equations of Electrodynamics to support different type of charges and be symmetrical.

______________

#### 1960's : ####

In the early 1960's Hadrons are found. Murray Gell-Mann &Amp; George Zweig propose the quark model. Hadrons of different mass, spins &Amp; lifetimes can be assembled using quarks (up, down and strange).

	Meson = Q + Q'.
	Baryon = 3Q.
	AntiBaryon = 3Q'.

These different alignments of different quarks are allowed in different states (orbits where there is a high probability of localizing the quarks). These different states have different energies; electrons in atom has different energies. The different energies represent different masses using the equation m = E/(c<sup>2</sup>).

Feynman gave up when he realized that the equations for QED introduced space filling fields that allowed interaction between electrons and photons. Electromagnetic field interacts with fluctuation in electron field.

______________

#### 1970's ####

Early 1970's : Jereome Friedman, henry Kendall, richard Taylor &Amp; collaborators at SLAC studies protons. SLAC gives the precise position &Amp; momentum for very precise time by taking multiple snapshots and taking a Fourier transform. Each image developed by SLAC looks like pepperoni pizza. With the pepperoni's at different places representing the Quarks.

___________

#### 1973 : ####

In 1973, David Gross and the author, Frank Wilczek proposed *Gluons* as a type of generalized Maxwell equations to accommodate more charges. They are called Colour charges. They explain strong forces and asymptotic freedom.

LEP shows us that the quarks(fundamental particles) are covered with their cloud of virtual particles which *antiscreen* them. When the particle and its cloud falls out of equilibrium a radiation of quark-antiquark pairs along with Gluons is seen.

In the LEP, the quark was out of equilibrium due to being suddenly expelled  out from a virtual photon. Hence we see

e + e' &rarr; &gamma; virtual photon &rarr; Q+ Q.

The quark and antiquark each have a cloud of virtual particles around them. The seed colour charge of the quark is very small but due to the screening by the virtual particles the charge appears to grow with distance. But when a quark and antiquark are in equilibrium they cancel out their charges. Antiscreening is the magnifying of the seed color charge by the virtual particles.
In 1973 the author and Gross came up with a relativistic Quantum Field theory to explain this. The author called this generalized Yang and Mills equations as QCD.

	> QCD has 3 colors(Red Blue and Green) and 3 flavours(Up Down and Strange).
	> Photon:electroMagnetic:QED :: Gluon:ColorCharge:QCD

##### GRID #####
__________________

QCD teaches us that the empty space is actually a powerful medium filled with activity and virtual particles that are alive for only seconds.
The author uses the term GRID as 'space-time' has the historic baggage of emptiness. But grid is essentially a new way to look at space time.
GRID view is actually viewing empty space as a super imposition of different grids over empty space
Empty Space + Quantum Fields + Metric Fields + Condensates + Dark Energy (4 layers on empty space make the grid)
Matter originally only had the properties of shape and motion. Now we add these 4 layers.

>	* The grid fills space and time
>	* Every grid fragment has the same basic properties.
>	* The grid is alive with quantum(spontaneous) activity. You must disturb it to observe it.
>	* The grid contains enduring material components. The cosmos is a multilayered, multicoloured cuperconductor.
>	* The grid contails a metric field that gives grid spacetime rigidity and causes gravity.
>	* The grid weighs with a universal density

___________

#### 1979 :####

Condensates :-
Empty space gives out a Q + Q' as QQ' molecules. These are called &sigma; mesons. &sigma; meson can be verified using their vibrations, the &pi; mesons. This lead to the Nobel prize in 1979 which got us the standard model or *Glashow-Weinberg-Salam* model.

	Activity in the W & Z boson fields generates weak interaction.
	Activity in photon field creates electromagnetism;
	Activity in color gluon fields creates strong interaction.

___________

#### 1998 : ####

In 1998 scientists/cosmic observers reported that the rate of expansion of our universe is increasing. The reason given was universal negative pressure. People started using the term dark energy as a standard to refer to both the mass and negative pressure of the grid.

___________

#### 2001 : ####

By 2001, scientists were able to measure cosmic densities and pressures separately by observing the cosmic microscope background radiation. In 2001 scientists also proclaimed that there is much more matter than that is observable &Amp; that 70% of it is uniformly distributed.


So the fact that the grid weights as & it has a non zero density is a proof of its physical reality.
Grid density = Einstiens cosmological term = "dark energy"

Gravity pulls energy not mass. Mass is energy at rest. Mass is the irreducible representation of Poincare's group.
	


### Some Interesting Concepts ###
_________________________________


Just like the electron behaves in a super conductor, the W&Amp;Z boson behave in a super-conducted manner in space. This makes us wonder if space is a giant Super conductor?
>	Electrons respond very vigorously in a superconductor to electric and magnetic fields. Photon is a moving electromagnetic wave which we have evolved to sense. The electrons try to balance the electromagnetic disturbance in a superconductor. Hence electron causes a drag on the photon in a superconductor causing the photon to slow down. The slowed down photon in a superconductor obeys the same equations as an object with mass. So if space was a good superconductor for (W & Z)bosons, then they get mass. But then what is the field that they exist in? How do we explain that? The answer is that the QQ' pair falls short of contributing to boson mass by a factor of thousand. So the scientists are searching for (Peter Higgs, physicist, who pioneered the idea)higgs condensate. So the idea comes along that the space is a multilayered, multicolored superconductor.


John Wheeler created the term "*its from bits*" i.e. finding mathematical structures (bits) that mirror reality so completely that no meaningful aspect escapes it.

The colour charge of a quark creates a disturbance in the grid's gluon field that grows with distance like a storm. To disturb the field requires lots of energy.
If you bring an antiquark close enough to the quark then you can cancel out the disturbances. But, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle does not allow the two QQ' to be close precisely and have the same momentum. Einstein's second law tells us that m = E/(c<sup>2</sup>). The nature of Q &Amp; Q' cannot be made 0 simultaneously. The balance energy *E* gives us the mass of the 95% of the matter. So the inertia of a body depends upon its energy content.
The masses of the particles correspond to the frequency with which the space vibrates. m = E/c<sup>2</sup> &Amp; E = h* &mu; .

So the empty space plays a tune a frequency by getting different combinations of quarks, electrons, photons, gluon's (The Bits represent the Its) and allowing them to settle their disturbance at a frequency &mu; that also describes their mass *m*. Our mind does a lossy compression of the data it receives from the universe. And decoding the messages is physics.

So gravity is *m* = *E* / *c*<sup>2</sup> where *E* is the energy difference between Q-Q' pair gluon field disturbance balancing act. It is a compromise in the equilibrium introduced due to Schroedinger's equations.
This E is in a sense a disturbance in a field. Mass is the residual disturbance left our after overlapping Q - Q' disturbances almost negate out each other.
This helps us explain why particles like photons weigh so little. Because the seed colour charge is very small the strong-force interaction between the Quark-Antiquark pair almost entirely negate each others colour charge. Hence the photons interaction with the gluon filed is minimal. This means the unbalanced energy is very small. hence the mass is very small, as mass is nothing but the energy.
This explanation of why gravity appears weak and why mass of the photon seems less is very beautiful. But to actually veryfy it we will need to 


We were very eautifully able to explain why gravity appears to be feeble and hence why the mass of the proton is small by observing the laws of physics. But to verify them we would need to craete energies for larger than LHC can measure. We need to look elsewhere.
The standard / core model organizes the particles as we find them. It has helpedis develop lasers, ultra small & reliable computer memories, nuclear reactors.

##Unification :-
_________________
Strong interaction of QCD explains how the color charges of the gluon fields cause the creation of hadrons like photons & neutrons out of quarks, antiquarks &Amp; gluons. The hadrons have their colour charges almost balanced but residual forces (the delta in localization of quarks) bind proton and neutrons togeather in an atomic nuclei. The electromagnetic interaction of the hypercharge in return binds electrons to the nuclei. This almost balances the electronic charges but the residual electronic charges causes creation of molecules & materials. The QED describes all these interactions along with all electromagnetic radiation.

The weak interaction performs alchemy. It changes different quark flavours into one another & different leptons into one another. Weak interaction causes nuclear chemistry. If one up quark in a proton is converted into a down quark the proton loses its charge and it becomes a neutron. It causes the atomic nucleus of one element to become another element. Stars derive energy by converting protons into neutrons.

So right now we explain weak interaction as vertical transformations in the core model & strong interactions as horizontal transformations.
Mathematically the most convincing way to put togeather QED, QCD and Gravity is to use a transformation called the SO(10). Doing so fits togeather the scatterd clusters of quarks & leptons togeather. This is called teh charge account. In SO(10) half get +1 charge the other half get -1 charge & can be transformed into one another using RBG color charge fields. What this translates into for core accout from charge account is that the color charges RBG cancel out and only negative charge is left for electron. The N-neutrino has no electric or weak colour charge (Green, Purple) or Strong Colour charge(R, B, G). This allows us to add on extra particles &mu;<sup>R</sup> that allow neutrinos to have tiny mass. Thus we get the unified theory (17.2 for diagrams).


SUSY - Super Symmetry
_____________________

SO(10) unified gauge bosons in a same cluster; and quarks and lepton in the same cluster. But ordinary symmetry cannot bring them into same custer as they are particles of different spins. To unify these, SYSY adds the spin of the particle as a dimension. When a body moves through a quantum dimension it gets displaced, i.e., Its spin changes. The superboost moves the particles & changes their spin. When a quantum particle moves through quantum dimensions its mass and spin changes- so does its position. But its charge remains the same(Color and EM).
Just like maxwell equations predicted moving Electric fields. SUSY predicts new fields. It doubles them. This allows us to unify gravity along with the electromangetic, weak and strong forces.
So right now we are smashing particles ar CERN at large speeds to break individual quanta of the condensates. This allowed us to make the Higgs particle. Higgs particle would helps us prove that the GRID acts superconductor to gluons and hence we can explain the origin of mass.
