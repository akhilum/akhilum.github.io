This book is a simple guide to start and run a startup. The author focuses on
creating simple businesses like travel websites and ticket books. It is a quick read. The book is well researched and this shows in all the details that the book provides. The book also shows the author's lifestyle. It touches all the topics of starting a startup and provides inspirational stories.

**The Good:-**

  
The author provides a definitive guide with examples for starting and running a
startup. He talks about many decisions that a “$100 entrepreneur” would have to
take and defends each piece of advise with lots of examples; lots of them. The
topics that I like how the author covers are :-

1.  Choosing a business idea

2.  Finding customers

3.  Increasing your market share

4.  Advertisement and raising funds among others.

  
**The Bad:-**

The author tries to give many examples about why it is a good idea to start your
own business. But proof by examples can only be used to disprove an idea and not
actually prove it.

Main themes of the book:-

1.  Find a right mixture of something you love to do, something people will pay
    you to do and something you are good at.

2.  Starting your own business in today's day and age does not require a huge
    investment.

3.  Testing and implementing your ideas is crucial.

4.  Growing a business through traditional advertising from the data set he
    studied is useless.

5.  It is always better to invest in winners. (successful ideas than invest to
    improve failures)
