excerpt: "The universe is a giant quantum computer. All of its matter and energy process information in such a manner that it computes itself. The author, Seth Lloyd, first gives a primer of how the universe is a giant information processing system in a lucid manner; then in a pedantic and dense language explains how the universe computed complicated things like life and human beings."

The author, Seth Lloyd, has tried to cram in a lot in information in this book. He talks about quantum mechanics, computation, Grand Unified Theory, quantum electrodynamics, thermodynamic complexity, entropy, human intelligence, evolution and sex! The first section of the book is an enlivening read where we get an overview of how the universe is actually a giant computer. The second section is dense and pedantic. It digresses a lot in order to describe the mechanics of how the universe came into being and was able to compute so much.

##Key Takeaways

###	Think of entropy as information.

The story of the universe begins right at the big bang. Initially there was just plain nothingness. There was just an even quantum field. The universe expanded and the energy in the quantum field was sucked out and this was balanced out by the creation of another force called gravity. There is a lot of free energy in the system which creates fluctuations in the fields that produces quantum particles. As the particles wobble and consume energy their wobbling reduces causing them to slow down enough to conglomerate to form larger particles that we see today.

We can explain the above occourance by stating the two laws of thermodynamics.
Conservaion of energy : The positive energy in the quantum fields is balanced by the negative energy of the gravitational fileld. Energy is conserved.
Entropy always increases : Entropy here is the amount of information required to describe the entire system. Right after the big bang there was just plain evenness and 1 bit of information is enough to explain the universe. But as time passed, the amount of information needed to describe the universe can only increase.


### The universe is a giant computer

The author introduces a plot twist and tells us that the entire universe, with all its energy and mass, (which can be represented as information) is actually a massive turing complete computer. It has been computing for the past 13.5 Billion years.

> What does the universe compute? It computes itself. The universe computes its own behavior. As soon as the universe began, it began computing. At first, the patterns it produced were simple, comprising elementary particles and establishing the fundamental laws of physics. In time, as it processed more and more information, the universe spun out ever more intricate and complex patterns, including galaxies, stars, and planets. Life, language, human beings, society, culture – all owe their existence to the intrinsic ability of matter and energy to process information.

The author has been using this capacity of the universe to build quantum computers that can solve complicated problems like finding prime numbers.

### Quantum Computing is powerful
