## Review

This book talks about quantum mechanics, theory of computation, information theory, grand unified theory, thermodynamic complexity, entropy, evolution and sex!

The first section of the book is a page turner, whereas, the second section is dense and pedantic. The first section gives us an overview of how the universe is actually a giant computer. The second section keeps digressing to elucidate the "efficient" giant computer.

## Summary

###	The universe began from nothingness.

Just after the [big bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang) the universe was nothing but an even quantum field the size of an atom.

Then the universe began expanding. Expansion sucked the enrgy out of the quantum field and this energy was balanced out, as per the first law of thermodynamics, by generating an equal gravitational field. The expansion of the universe increases entropy. Hence, Universe if still expanding.

Free energy generated by the expansion was rapidly consumed by the quantum particles created by the quantum field fluctuations during the expansion. These quantum particles began to stabilize after consuming the energy and slowed down enough to conglomerate and form the particles that we know today.

### Universe is a giant computer

The author explains to us that that the entire universe, with all its energy and mass, is actually a massive [turing complete computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness). It has been computing for the past 13.5 Billion years.

The expanding universe keeps increasing the entropy of the universe. You can think of entopy, as defined by equations of Max Plank, as the amount of bits needed to represent all the matter and energy in the system. 

The universe is generating random bits just like a monkey with a typewriter. The possiblity of the monkey typing out anything meaningful is very small. But if the monkey were to type out on a computer then the probability that the monkey can generate a sequence of bytes that the computer can interpret as a valid instruction is much higer. **Similarly, if the universe were to interpret its bits as a computer program, then as per the theory of [algorithmic complexity](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v341/n6238/abs/341119a0.html), it can create complicated structures such as the human DNA.**

**Things that can be meaningfully generated by the simplest programs occur more often**. Long *complex* programs are much less likely to be correctly generated by the random bits. A better way to look at complexity is thermodynamic complexity, it is the number of useful bits required to represent the object. A least thermodynamically complex structure would occur more abundantly in the universe. Helium atoms and salt crystals are not as complex as the human DNA and they occour more abundantly.

The author tells us that he has been successful in using the computational capacity of the universe to build quantum computers. He proposes that quantum computers will be much more efficient than regular computers.

### The world evolved - “Computed Itself”

The author published a paper “Effective complexity” along with Murray Gell-Mann that explains how complicated beings like humans evolved by nesting simpler structures. Such a nesting allows the universe to compute more complicated structures.

Seth Lloyd goes on to give examples of genome evolution and genetic variation injected by sexual reproduction to drive home this point. He says that “Sex builds on life, brain on sex, language on brain”. The universe generates, stores and processes its own information according to the laws of physics.

**If I may say so in computer science lingo - Prefer composition over inheritance.**

> What does the universe compute? It computes itself. The universe computes its own behavior. As soon as the universe began, it began computing. At first, the patterns it produced were simple, comprising elementary particles and establishing the fundamental laws of physics. In time, as it processed more and more information, the universe spun out ever more intricate and complex patterns, including galaxies, stars, and planets. Life, language, human beings, society, culture – all owe their existence to the intrinsic ability of matter and energy to process information.


### What is the universe computing?

[Halting Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem): The result of a computation cannot be determined by another computation that simulates the same computation.

> When you go to a hotel and the waiter asks you what “What do you want for dinner?”. <br/> Even you cannot determine what you want until you come to a conclusion. <br/> Similarly the only way to know the result of universe’s computation is by looking at the result.

On a side note there is a faction that thinks that the "[theme of creation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIW4MvpMyUY)" is that the universe is computing itself to realize itself. The creation is never satisfied and goes on evolving till it becomes the god in itself. But as the halting problem suggests, the only way to find out is by computing, i.e., living.

## Conclusion

The book has the potential to leave all its readers in awe and a feeling of harmony with the world. But the book is abstruse and lacks a story line leaving the reader feeling like he/she is reading a dense university textbook.
