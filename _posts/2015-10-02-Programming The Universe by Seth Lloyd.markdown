This book talks about quantum mechanics, theory of computation, information theory, grand unified theory, quantum electrodynamics, thermodynamic complexity, entropy, human intelligence, evolution and sex!

The first section of the book is a page turner, whereas, the second section is dense and pedantic. The first section gives us an overview of how the universe is actually a giant computer. The second section keeps digressing to describe the mechanics behind the aforementioned "efficient" giant computer.

##Key Takeaways :
____________________

###	1. Think of entropy as information.

The story of the universe began with a [big bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang). The universe was the size of an atom and it consisted of an even quantum field. It expanded and the energy in the quantum field was sucked out; this was balanced out by the creation of an opposite force called gravity. There was a lot of free energy in the system which created fluctuations in the fields that produced quantum particles. As the particles wobbled and consumed energy their wobbling reduced, causing them to slow down enough to conglomerate to form larger particles that we see today.

The two laws of thermodynamics help us understand what happened during the big bang :

**Conservation of energy** : The positive energy generated by the quantum fields is balanced by the negative energy of the gravitational field. Energy is conserved.

**Entropy always increases** : Entropy here can be understood as the amount of information required to describe the entire system. Right after the big bang there was just plain evenness and 1 bit of information is enough to explain the universe. But as time passed, the amount of information needed to describe the universe can only increase.


### 2. The universe is a giant computer

The author explains to us that that the entire universe, with all its energy and mass, is actually a massive [turing complete computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness). It has been computing for the past 13.5 Billion years.

> What does the universe compute? It computes itself. The universe computes its own behavior. As soon as the universe began, it began computing. At first, the patterns it produced were simple, comprising elementary particles and establishing the fundamental laws of physics. In time, as it processed more and more information, the universe spun out ever more intricate and complex patterns, including galaxies, stars, and planets. Life, language, human beings, society, culture – all owe their existence to the intrinsic ability of matter and energy to process information.

The author tells us that he has been successful in using the computational capacity of the universe to build quantum computers. He proposes that quantum computers will be much more efficient than regular computers.

### 3. Quantum Computing is powerful

He uses the theory of [algorithmic complexity](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v341/n6238/abs/341119a0.html) to illustrate how the universe can create such complicated structures as human beings.

![Universe generates random bits like a monkey with a typewriter](/assets/images/programming_the_universe_2.jpg)

The expanding universe keeps adding more entropy to the universe, hence the number of bits in the universe keeps on increasing. The probability of the stream of random bits generated by the expanding universe being used to describe anything meaningful is too small; just as the probability of a monkey randomly typing at a typewriter writing the works of shakespeare. But, if the universe treated these bits as a representation of meaningful instructions, like a computer program, then the probability of these bits to generate a sequence of instructions to mean something useful is much higher.

> The universe generates, stores and processes its own information according to the laws of physics. The “complexity in this world arose out of simplicity”. “Intelligent design” of the universe (complexity) is not the work of the intelligent designer but a result of the evolution of the universe.

This explains how some of the patterns are seen so often in the nature. **Things that can be meaningfully generated by the simplest programs occur more often. Long programs are much less likely to be correctly generated by the random bits**. A better way to look at complexity is (derived from algorithmic complexity – logical depth by Charles Bennett in 1980’s) thermodynamic complexity is the number of useful bits required to represent the object. A least thermodynamically complex structure would occur more abundantly in the universe. Helium atoms and salt crystals are not as complex as the human DNA.

The author quotes the medieval philosopher William of Occam *“Pluralitas non est ponenda sin necessitate”*; i.e. *“‘Plurality should not be posited without necessity.’ Occam urged us to accept simple explanations over complex ones.”*

### 4. The world evolved ( “Computed Itself” )

The author published a paper “Effective complexity” along with Murray Gell-Mann that explains how complicated beings like humans can come into being by nesting simpler structures. Seth Lloyd goes on to give examples of genome evolution and genetic variation injected is sexual production to drive home this point. He says that “Sex builds on life, brain on sex, language on brain”.

**THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE** is one giant information processing revolution. Complicated structures store their design as an assembly of its components. There is a nesting of complexity that enables the world to compute more and more complicated structures. 

### 5. What is the universe computing?

[HALTING PROBLEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem): The result of a computation cannot be determined by another computation that simulates the same computation.

> When you go to a hotel and the waiter asks you what “What do you want for dinner?”. Even you cannot determine what you want until you come to a conclusion. Similarly the only way to know the result of universe’s computation is by looking at the result.

On a side note there is a faction that thinks that the "[theme of creation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIW4MvpMyUY)" is that the universe is computing itself to realize itself. The creation is never satisfied and goes on evolving till it becomes the god in itself. But as the halting problem suggests, the only way to find out is by computing, a.k.a. living.


## Conclusion

The book has the potential to leave all its readers in awe and a feeling of harmony with the world. But (there is always a but) it will take up a significant time of your life to finish reading this book. The book is abstruse and lacks a story line leaving the reader feeling like he/she is reading a course material.

The author also observes that computing capacity cannot double for ever as per Moore's law as it would become nearly equal to quantum computational power by 2030. **You cannot build a computer faster than the quantum computer you are building it on**. Such an observation makes me want to ruminate on its implications on computer science.
