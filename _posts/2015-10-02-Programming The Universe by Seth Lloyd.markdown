excerpt: "The universe is a giant quantum computer. All of its matter and energy process information in such a manner that it computes itself. The author, Seth Lloyd, first gives a primer of how the universe is a giant information processing system in a lucid manner; then in a pedantic and dense language explains how the universe computed complicated things like life and human beings."

The author, Seth Lloyd, has tried to cram in a lot in information in this book. He talks about quantum mechanics, computation, Grand Unified Theory, quantum electrodynamics, thermodynamic complexity, entropy, human intelligence, evolution and sex! The first section of the book is an enlivening read where we get an overview of how the universe is actually a giant computer. The second section is dense and pedantic. It digresses a lot in order to describe the mechanics of how the universe came into being and was able to compute so much.

##Key Takeaways

###	Think of entropy as information.

The story of the universe begins right at the big bang. Initially there was just plain nothingness. There was just an even quantum field. The universe expanded and the energy in the quantum field was sucked out and this was balanced out by the creation of another force called gravity. There is a lot of free energy in the system which creates fluctuations in the fields that produces quantum particles. As the particles wobble and consume energy their wobbling reduces causing them to slow down enough to conglomerate to form larger particles that we see today.

We can explain the above occourance by stating the two laws of thermodynamics.
Conservaion of energy : The positive energy in the quantum fields is balanced by the negative energy of the gravitational fileld. Energy is conserved.
Entropy always increases : Entropy here is the amount of information required to describe the entire system. Right after the big bang there was just plain evenness and 1 bit of information is enough to explain the universe. But as time passed, the amount of information needed to describe the universe can only increase.


### The universe is a giant computer

The author introduces a plot twist and tells us that the entire universe, with all its energy and mass, (which can be represented as information) is actually a massive turing complete computer. It has been computing for the past 13.5 Billion years.

> What does the universe compute? It computes itself. The universe computes its own behavior. As soon as the universe began, it began computing. At first, the patterns it produced were simple, comprising elementary particles and establishing the fundamental laws of physics. In time, as it processed more and more information, the universe spun out ever more intricate and complex patterns, including galaxies, stars, and planets. Life, language, human beings, society, culture – all owe their existence to the intrinsic ability of matter and energy to process information.

The author has been using this capacity of the universe to build quantum computers that can solve complicated problems like finding prime numbers.

### Quantum Computing is powerful

 He uses the theory of algorithmic complexity to define how the universe can create complicated structures. The probability of random bits being used to describe anything meaningful is too small; but if you treat these bits as a representation of meaningful instructions, then the probability of these bits to generate a sequence of instructions to mean something useful is much higher. The universe generates, stores and processes its own information according to the laws of physics. The “complexity in this world arose out of simplicity”. “Intelligent design” of the universe (complexity) is not the work of the intelligent designer but a result of the evolution of the universe. The author quotes the medieval philosopher William of Occam “Pluralitas non est ponenda sin necessitate”; i.e. “‘Plurality should not be posited without necessity.’ Occam urged us to accept simple explanations over complex ones.”

 ### The world evolved ( “Computed Itself” )

 Seth Lloyd goes on to give examples of genome evolution and genetic variation injected is sexual production to drive home this point. He says that “Sex build on life, brain on sex, language on brain”. Information is nested as design models, i.e. the amount of information required to represent an airplane is as much as the one used to represent its design. It need not be represented as the information in each atom of aluminium in its body. He explains how earth must be 3Billion years old, how life came after that, genome even later and language after that. The entire universe is one giant information processing revolution.

 ### What is the universe computing?

 HALTING Problem: The result of a computation cannot be determined by another computation that simulates the same computation. The author gives an excellent example to understand this. As per the theory humans are also quantum computing beings. So when you go to a hotel and the waiter asks you what “What do you want for dinner ?”. Even you cannot determine what you want until you come to a conclusion. Similarly the only way to know the result of universe’s computation is by looking at the result.
 On a side note there is a sect that thinks that the entire universe is evolving by asking itself “Who am I”. The universe asked itself who am I and it realized itself as matter. Then it asked itself “Who am I” for this it realized itself as stones. Then further again as crystalline matter and more structured elements. Then further as organic matter and life. Then as amoeba and fishes. Then as invertebrates. Then as vertebrates that cannot stand straight. Then as humans. As the universe evolved it invented animalistic intuition and then intelligence. This sect and thought is unique to Meher Baba.


All in all I do not recommend anyone to read this book. It will take up a significant time of your life to finish reading this book. The book is very dense and pedantic. The second section of the book is highly unconnected. The book would have benefited from being written as a story. If I would have written this book I would have taken the example of using quantum computing to calculate prime numbers and use this problem to explain all the above concepts. The second half is a very slow read where you feel that the author rambles on to drive home the concepts. The author does go on to say that without a quantum theory of gravity a quantum computing Grand Unification Theory is not possible. The author also observes that computing capacity cannot double for ever. It would soon become nearly equal to quantum computational power by 2030. ( This follows from the fact that a Universal Digital Computer, takes bits and computes and one is equivalent to another. You cannot build a quantum computer faster than the quantum computer you are building it on. )
