excerpt: "The universe is a giant quantum computer. All of its matter and energy process information in such a manner that it computes itself. The author, Seth Lloyd, first gives a primer of how the universe is a giant information processing system in a lucid manner; then in a pedantic and dense language explains how the universe computed complicated things like life and human beings."

The author, Seth Lloyd, has tried to cram in a lot in information in this book. He talks about quantum mechanics, computation, Grand Unified Theory, quantum electrodynamics, thermodynamic complexity, entropy, human intelligence, evolution and sex! The first half of the book is an enlivening read where we get an overview of how the universe is actually a giant computer. The second section digresses a lot to describe the mechanics of how the universe came into being and was able to compute so much. The language used in the second half is dense and pedantic.
